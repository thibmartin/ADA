### Introduction :

#### Abstract:

Gun ownership and regulation is a very divisive topic in the United States. It is clear that the country faces a problem with **gun violence**, this is reflected by the **yearly 14 000 deaths following gun related homicides** (statistic for 2019). However, people&#39;s opinions over how this problem should be tackled differ greatly.

In the case of our project, we basically want to know :

&quot;Who is thinking what and when?&quot;.

This includes, political **shifts in opinion**, the differing impacts of shooting event types in the public eye, and the **temporal evolution** of public opinions.

We wish to include an external dataset containing shooting events information and cross-reference with the QuoteBank dataset to see how given events influence what is said publicly, and how much these events take over the press.

#### Research questions:

How do general opinions in the media shift following gun shooting events?

How does the political sphere, and the opinion of significant public figures, evolve in relation to gun shootings?

#### Methods:

In our Data story, we want to use the Quotebank dataset to analyze a **potential shift in opinion around gun shootings events in the United States**. In order to do so we will select relevant quotes for our topic using a set of keywords. Then we will first analyze the obtain dataset, and perform sentimental analysis on it. Finally we will compare the results with a gun shooting dataset obtained from (https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/). We will try to highlight the shifts in sentimental score around relevant selected events from this dataset.
